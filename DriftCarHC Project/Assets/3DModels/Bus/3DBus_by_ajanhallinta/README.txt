- 3D Bus by ajanhallinta -

Published under CC0 -License.


This bus is going to be on my own WIP racing game, 'Folk Rally'... but have it free anyway! No textures used, only materials. Also it doesn't have an interior.

The model is made entirely using Blender.

Package contains: .blend, .fbx and .obj -files.


Total Polycount:

Verts: 7.352
Faces: 5.669
Tris: 14.507


The model is separated to five different meshes:

- Body (Bus_Body)

Verts: 1.732
Faces: 5.669
Tris: 14.507


- 4x Duplicate Wheels (wheelFL, wheelRL, wheelFR, wheelRR)

Verts: 1.405
Faces: 1.031
Tris: 2.766


Attribution is not required, since it's CC0. But feel free to credit "ajanhallinta" as a maker of this model but not needed.


Any criticism is always welcome!
